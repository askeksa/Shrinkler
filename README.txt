
Shrinkler executable file compressor for Amiga by Blueberry

Designed for maximum compression of Amiga 64k and 4k intros, and
everything in between.

Executables for different platforms are available in their respective
subdirectories. The output executables are compatible with all Amiga CPUs
and kickstarts.

Run with no arguments for a list of options. For the options controlling
compression efficiency, higher values generally result in better
compression, at the cost of higher time and/or memory requirements.


History:

1999 - 2012: Various public and internal versions.

2014-01-05:  Version 4.0. First public release with new name.
